# Inspiration
We decided to make BotOfWar because we wanted to hone our skills in game development by going for a much larger game with more mechanics.

# What it does
Bot Of War is a game where you need to find your way out of the city by fighting enemies. There are many enemies to defeat along the way, and there will be a boss battle in the end.

# How we built it
Bot Of War was built using the Unity game engine and was designed with various publicly available 3D assets. The scripts were coded in C#.

# Challenges we ran into
Due to the lack of game design and development experience across the team, we faced the following challenges:

* Getting physics to work
* Finding Assets
* Fixing Lighting and Shadows (Which are still very buggy)
* Accomplishments that we're proud of
* Building a playable game while still in 11th grade
* Despite being our second game, we were able to make a 3D game right away
* Being able to make an improved combat system with health bars and more complex enemy AI
* Having a more coherent story

# What we learned
* Physics Simulation In Unity
* More Complex C#
* Basic AI for enemies
* 3D game design in Unity
* Creating Healthbars
* 3D is like 2D, but with an extra dimension
* Creating complex enemy AI, aggro ranges, sight, subroutines, formations

# Future Improvements
* Improve the lighting
* Improve enemy AI and variety
* Make some cutscenes
* Add quest markers so that players know where they are going
* More Animations
* Adding more levels
* Introducing new mechanics and gameplay
* More enemies

# Acknowledgements
We want to thank everyone WinHacks for giving us this opportunity, Unity for providing us with student licenses and the assets for the main character and the background, Polygon Blacksmith for the enemy models, Triplebrick for the final boss, and Sabri Ayes for some environmental assets.
