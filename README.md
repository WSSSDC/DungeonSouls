# Inspiration
We decided to make Dungeon Souls because we wanted to hone our skills in game development by going for a much larger game with more mechanics.

# Background
You're a bounty hunter looking to make some quick bucks. You've heard of this evil and filthy rich goblin king living in an abandoned castle far away from any civilization. You make it your mission to defeat the goblin king and his minions and take over the castle for yourself.

# How we built it
Dungeon Souls was built using the Unity game engine and was designed with Synty low-poly asset packs. The scripts were coded in C#. It took 830 assets, XXX soundtracks and, 1550 lines of code written by us (Total: 6.95K).

# Challenges we ran into
* Getting physics to work
* Enemy A.I.
* Camera Controls
* Balancing combat
* Animations not meshing together

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
* Being able to make an improved combat system with health bars and more varied enemy AI
* Getting animations for more fluid gamplay
* A lot of new enemy types (12)
* Adding bow combat
* Adding music and other ambient sounds to improve the experience

# What we learned
* Physics Simulation In Unity
* More Complex C#
* More advanced 3D game design in Unity
* Better Healthbars and HUD
* 3D is like 2D, but with an extra dimension
* Creating complex enemy AI, aggro ranges, sight, ideal radius from player, subroutines, formations

# Future Improvements
* Improve the lighting
* Add an inventory system
* Improve enemy AI and variety
* Cutscenes
* More Animations
* Adding more levels
* Introducing new mechanics and gameplay
* More enemies
