# Inspiration
We decided to make Dungeon Souls because we wanted to hone our skills in game development by going for a much larger game with more mechanics.

# What it does


# How we built it
Dungeon Souls was built using the Unity game engine and was designed with various publicly available 3D assets. The scripts were coded in C#.

# Challenges we ran into
Due to the lack of game design and development experience across the team, we faced the following challenges:

* Getting physics to work
* Finding Assets
* Fixing Lighting and Shadows (Which are still very buggy)
* Accomplishments that we're proud of
* Being able to make an improved combat system with health bars and more complex enemy AI

# What we learned
* Physics Simulation In Unity
* More Complex C#
* Basic AI for enemies
* 3D game design in Unity
* Creating Healthbars
* 3D is like 2D, but with an extra dimension
* Creating complex enemy AI, aggro ranges, sight, subroutines, formations

# Future Improvements
* Improve the lighting
* Add an inventory system
* Improve enemy AI and variety
* Make some cutscenes
* Add quest markers so that players know where they are going
* More Animations
* Adding more levels
* Introducing new mechanics and gameplay
* More enemies
