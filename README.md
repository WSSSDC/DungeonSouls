# Inspiration
We decided to make Dungeon Souls because we wanted to hone our skills in game development by going for a much larger game with more mechanics.

# Background
You have been summoned by the King to rid this ancienct castle of goblins, you must fight your way through droves of goblins to rid the castle of this wicked scourge. [CHANGE LATER]

# How we built it
Dungeon Souls was built using the Unity game engine and was designed with Synty asset packs. The scripts were coded in C#. It took XXX assets, XXX soundtracks and, XXX lines of code.

# Challenges we ran into
Due to the lack of game design and development experience across the team, we faced the following challenges:

* Getting physics to work
* Finding Assets
* Fixing Lighting and Shadows

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
* Being able to make an improved combat system with health bars and more complex enemy AI
* Making animations for more fluid gamplay
* A lot of new enemy types (12)
* Adding bow combat
* Cutscenes

# What we learned
* Physics Simulation In Unity
* More Complex C#
* Basic AI for enemies
* 3D game design in Unity
* Creating Healthbars and the HUD
* 3D is like 2D, but with an extra dimension
* Creating complex enemy AI, aggro ranges, sight, ideal radius from player, subroutines, formations

# Future Improvements
* Improve the lighting
* Add an inventory system
* Improve enemy AI and variety
* Make some cutscenes
* More Animations
* Adding more levels
* Introducing new mechanics and gameplay
* More enemies

# Acknowledgements
We want to thank everyone RUHacks2021 for giving us this opportunity. We would also like to thank Synty for the assets and Unity for putting them on sale ðŸ˜œ.
